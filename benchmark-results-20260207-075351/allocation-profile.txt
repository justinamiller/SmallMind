--- MatMul Backward Pass Allocation Profile ---
This benchmark measures allocation reduction from using ArrayPool
for temporary gradient buffers in MatMul backward pass.

Matrix dimensions: 128×256 @ 256×128 = 128×128
Iterations: 100
Total time: 304ms
Avg time per iteration: 3.043ms

Memory Metrics:
  Total allocations: 13.21 MB
  Allocations per iteration: 135.24 KB
  Gen0 Collections: 0
  Gen1 Collections: 0
  Gen2 Collections: 0

Analysis:
  Expected allocations WITHOUT pooling: 25.00 MB
  Expected per iteration: 256.00 KB
  Estimated reduction: 47.2%
  ⚠️  Lower than expected reduction

--- Training Workload Allocation Profile ---
Simulates a mini training loop to measure overall allocation impact.

Steps: 50
Batch size: 32, Hidden size: 256
Total time: 21ms
Avg time per step: 0.425ms

Memory Metrics:
  Total allocations: 3.77 MB
