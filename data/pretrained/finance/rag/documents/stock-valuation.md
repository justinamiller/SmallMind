# Fundamentals of Stock Valuation

## Introduction

Stock valuation determines whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced. Multiple methodologies exist, each with strengths and limitations.

## Common Valuation Metrics

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)

**Formula**: P/E = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

**Interpretation**:
- Low P/E (< 15): Potentially undervalued or troubled company
- Average P/E (15-25): Fair value for stable growth companies
- High P/E (> 25): Growth expectations or overvaluation

**Limitations**: Ignores debt, future growth, and industry differences

### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)

**Formula**: P/B = Stock Price / Book Value Per Share

**Interpretation**:
- P/B < 1.0: Stock trading below net asset value
- P/B 1.0-3.0: Typical range for most companies
- P/B > 3.0: Premium valuation or asset-light business

**Best Used For**: Banks, real estate, and capital-intensive industries

### Dividend Yield

**Formula**: Dividend Yield = Annual Dividends / Stock Price

**Interpretation**:
- 0-2%: Low yield, growth-oriented company
- 2-4%: Moderate yield, balanced approach
- 4%+: High yield, income-focused investment

**Warning**: Extremely high yields may indicate dividend risk

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF calculates intrinsic value by estimating future cash flows and discounting them to present value.

### Steps:
1. Project free cash flows for 5-10 years
2. Estimate terminal value beyond projection period
3. Determine appropriate discount rate (WACC)
4. Discount all cash flows to present value
5. Sum to calculate intrinsic value

### Strengths:
- Theoretically sound valuation method
- Accounts for time value of money
- Focuses on cash generation ability

### Weaknesses:
- Highly sensitive to assumptions
- Difficult for unprofitable or cyclical companies
- Requires detailed financial modeling

## Comparable Company Analysis

Compares valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S) to similar companies.

### Process:
1. Identify peer companies in same industry
2. Calculate valuation multiples for peers
3. Determine median or mean multiples
4. Apply multiples to target company metrics

**Advantage**: Market-based, relative valuation
**Limitation**: Quality varies with peer selection

## Growth vs. Value Investing

### Growth Stocks
- High P/E ratios, minimal/no dividends
- Rapid revenue and earnings growth
- Technology, biotech sectors
- Higher volatility and risk

### Value Stocks
- Low P/E and P/B ratios
- Stable dividends
- Mature industries
- Lower volatility, slower growth

## Conclusion

No single valuation method is perfect. Combining multiple approaches provides a more complete picture of a stock's true value. Consider both quantitative metrics and qualitative factors like management quality, competitive advantages, and industry trends.
