# Financial Risk Management

## Introduction

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling financial risks that could negatively impact an organization's capital and earnings. Effective risk management protects value and enables informed decision-making.

## Types of Financial Risk

### Market Risk
Risk of losses due to changes in market prices.

**Subtypes**:
- **Equity Risk**: Stock price fluctuations
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Bond price changes due to rate movements
- **Currency Risk**: Exchange rate fluctuations
- **Commodity Risk**: Price changes in raw materials

**Measurement**: Value at Risk (VaR), stress testing, scenario analysis

### Credit Risk
Risk that a borrower will default on obligations.

**Components**:
- **Default Risk**: Complete failure to pay
- **Credit Spread Risk**: Widening of credit spreads
- **Downgrade Risk**: Credit rating deterioration

**Mitigation**: Credit analysis, diversification, collateral, credit derivatives

### Liquidity Risk
Risk of inability to buy or sell assets quickly without significant price impact.

**Types**:
- **Market Liquidity Risk**: Inability to execute transactions
- **Funding Liquidity Risk**: Inability to meet cash obligations

**Management**: Maintain cash reserves, diversify funding sources, stress test scenarios

### Operational Risk
Risk of loss from inadequate processes, people, systems, or external events.

**Sources**:
- Technology failures
- Fraud and human error
- Process breakdowns
- External events (natural disasters, cyberattacks)

**Controls**: Internal controls, audit procedures, business continuity planning

### Regulatory/Compliance Risk
Risk of legal penalties, material financial loss, or reputational damage from failure to comply with laws and regulations.

**Mitigation**: Compliance programs, regulatory monitoring, training, internal audit

## Risk Measurement Techniques

### Value at Risk (VaR)
Maximum expected loss over a specific time period at a given confidence level.

**Example**: 1-day 95% VaR of $1 million means:
- 95% probability losses won't exceed $1M in one day
- 5% probability losses could be greater

**Limitations**: Doesn't specify loss magnitude beyond threshold, assumes normal distributions

### Stress Testing
Evaluates portfolio performance under extreme but plausible scenarios.

**Approaches**:
- Historical scenarios (e.g., 2008 financial crisis)
- Hypothetical scenarios (custom adverse conditions)
- Reverse stress testing (identify breaking points)

### Scenario Analysis
Assesses impact of specific events or conditions on portfolio value.

### Sensitivity Analysis
Measures how changes in one variable affect outcomes while holding others constant.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Diversification
Spreading investments across uncorrelated assets reduces concentration risk.

### Hedging
Using derivatives or other instruments to offset potential losses.

**Common Hedges**:
- **Options**: Protective puts, covered calls
- **Futures**: Lock in prices for commodities or currencies
- **Swaps**: Interest rate swaps, currency swaps
- **Forward Contracts**: Customized price locks

### Insurance
Transferring risk to an insurance company for a premium.

### Position Limits
Restricting maximum exposure to any single asset, sector, or counterparty.

### Stop-Loss Orders
Automatic sell orders triggered when prices fall to specified levels.

## Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics

### Sharpe Ratio
**Formula**: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation
**Interpretation**: Return per unit of risk; higher is better

### Sortino Ratio
Similar to Sharpe but uses downside deviation instead of total volatility.

### Information Ratio
Measures risk-adjusted returns relative to a benchmark.

### Maximum Drawdown
Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value.

## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

### Framework Components
1. **Risk Identification**: Catalog all potential risks
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood and impact
3. **Risk Response**: Develop mitigation strategies
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Track and report risk metrics
5. **Risk Governance**: Establish oversight and accountability

### Risk Appetite
- **Risk Tolerance**: Maximum acceptable risk level
- **Risk Capacity**: Maximum risk organization can bear
- **Risk Limits**: Quantitative boundaries on exposures

## Regulatory Capital Requirements

### Basel III Framework
International banking regulations requiring:
- Minimum capital ratios
- Liquidity coverage ratios
- Leverage ratio caps
- Stress testing

### Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)
Different asset types assigned risk weights:
- Cash: 0% weight
- Government bonds: 0-20% weight
- Corporate bonds: 20-150% weight
- Equity: 100% weight

## Risk Culture and Governance

### Three Lines of Defense
1. **First Line**: Business units own and manage risk
2. **Second Line**: Risk management provides oversight
3. **Third Line**: Internal audit provides independent assurance

### Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
Senior executive responsible for enterprise-wide risk management.

### Risk Committees
Board-level committees overseeing risk strategy and exposures.

## Emerging Risks

### Climate Risk
- **Physical Risk**: Damage from extreme weather
- **Transition Risk**: Policy changes, technology shifts
- **Liability Risk**: Legal actions related to climate impact

### Cyber Risk
- Data breaches and theft
- Ransomware attacks
- System disruptions
- Reputational damage

### Model Risk
Risk of incorrect decisions based on flawed models or improper model use.

## Conclusion

Effective risk management is not about eliminating risk but understanding, measuring, and managing it within acceptable boundaries. A robust risk management framework protects capital, supports strategic objectives, and maintains stakeholder confidence.
