# ITIL v4 Service Request Management Practice

## Purpose

Support the agreed quality of a service by handling all pre-defined, user-initiated service requests in an effective and user-friendly manner.

## Key Concepts

**Service Request**: A request from a user or authorized representative for something to be provided (e.g., information, advice, standard change, access)

**Service Catalog**: Published list of available service requests

**Request Fulfillment**: End-to-end process of handling service requests

Service requests are NOT incidents—they're planned needs, not unplanned disruptions.

## Common Service Request Types

- Access rights (application access, file permissions, VPN)
- Information (documentation, reports, status updates)
- Hardware/software provisioning (laptop, mobile device, licensed software)
- Standard changes (password reset, email distribution list update)
- Advice and consultation ("How do I…?")

## Do's

✅ Define standard service requests in catalog
✅ Provide self-service portal where possible
✅ Automate approval and fulfillment workflows
✅ Set clear SLA targets and track them
✅ Integrate with change management for standard changes
✅ Measure customer satisfaction

## Don'ts

❌ Treat requests as incidents (separate workflows)
❌ Require manual approval for routine requests
❌ Hide service catalog from users
❌ Let requests languish without status updates

## Key Metrics

- Average fulfillment time
- Self-service adoption rate
- % auto-approved
- User satisfaction score
- Request volume trends
