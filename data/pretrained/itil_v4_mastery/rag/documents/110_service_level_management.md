# ITIL v4 Service Level Management Practice

## Purpose

Set clear business-based targets for service performance so delivery can be assessed, monitored, and managed against these targets.

## Key Concepts

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: Documented agreement between service provider and customer defining expected service levels

**Operational Level Agreement (OLA)**: Agreement between parts of same organization supporting SLA delivery

**Underpinning Contract (UC)**: Contract with external supplier supporting service delivery

**Service Level Objectives (SLO)**: Specific measurable targets within an SLA

## SLA Types

### Customer-Based SLA
Agreement with specific customer (e.g., Finance Dept SLA)

### Service-Based SLA
Agreement covering specific service for all users (e.g., Email SLA)

### Multi-Level SLA
Combination of corporate, customer, and service levels

## Common SLA Metrics

- Availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
- Performance (e.g., response time <2 sec)
- Incident response/resolution times (e.g., P1 <4 hours)
- Change success rate (e.g., >95%)
- Request fulfillment time (e.g., access granted <24 hours)

## Do's

✅ Define measurable, achievable targets
✅ Align SLAs with business needs
✅ Review SLA performance regularly with customers
✅ Ensure monitoring can track SLA metrics
✅ Cascade SLAs to OLAs and UCs
✅ Include consequences for breaches (escalation, credits)

## Don'ts

❌ Set unmeetable targets to impress customers
❌ Track metrics you can't actually measure
❌ Create SLAs without consulting operations teams
❌ Ignore SLA breaches

## Key Metrics

- SLA compliance % (met vs. total commitments)
- Breach frequency and severity
- Customer satisfaction with service levels
- Cost of delivering SLA vs. customer value
