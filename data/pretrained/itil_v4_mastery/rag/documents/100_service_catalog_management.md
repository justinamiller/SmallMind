# ITIL v4 Service Catalog Management Practice

## Purpose

Provide a single source of consistent information on all services and service offerings, and ensure it is available to the appropriate audience.

## Key Concepts

**Service Catalog**: Published, customer-facing list of available IT services with descriptions, owners, pricing (if applicable), and request procedures

**Service Portfolio**: Complete set of services managed by provider (includes catalog, pipeline, retired services)

**Service Offering**: Description of one or more services designed to address specific consumer needs

## Catalog Types

### Customer-Facing Catalog
Services users can request (email, file storage, applications)

### Technical Catalog
Supporting services and components (databases, network, infrastructure)

## Do's

✅ Make catalog easily searchable and accessible
✅ Include accurate SLA commitments
✅ Provide pricing/cost information if applicable
✅ Keep catalog current (add/remove services)
✅ Link catalog to request fulfillment workflows
✅ Segment by audience (end users, developers, partners)

## Don'ts

❌ Include services not actually available
❌ Use technical jargon users don't understand
❌ Let catalog become stale
❌ Omit service dependencies

## Key Metrics

- Catalog accuracy (% services listed that are actually available)
- Service adoption rates
- Time to publish new services
- User satisfaction with catalog
