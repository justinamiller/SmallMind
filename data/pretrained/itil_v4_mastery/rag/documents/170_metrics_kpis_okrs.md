# ITIL v4 Metrics, KPIs, and OKRs

## Purpose

Provide practical guidance on measuring ITSM effectiveness and aligning IT with business outcomes.

## Metrics vs. KPIs vs. OKRs

**Metric**: Any measurable data point (e.g., ticket count, CPU usage)

**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**: Critical metric indicating success against objectives (e.g., MTTR, SLA compliance %)

**OKR (Objectives and Key Results)**: Goal-setting framework linking objectives to measurable results

## Essential ITSM KPIs

### Availability and Reliability
- Service uptime %
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
- Mean time to restore service (MTRS)

### Incident and Problem Management
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR)
- First-call resolution rate
- Incident recurrence rate
- Problem closure rate

### Change Management
- Change success rate
- Emergency change %
- Change lead time

### Service Desk
- Abandonment rate (calls dropped)
- Average handle time
- Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)

### Cost and Efficiency
- Cost per incident
- Cost per user
- Service cost vs. business value delivered

## OKR Examples for ITSM

**Objective**: Improve service reliability

**Key Results**:
- Increase uptime from 99.5% to 99.9%
- Reduce P1 incidents by 40%
- Achieve zero unplanned outages >4 hours

**Objective**: Accelerate service delivery

**Key Results**:
- Reduce change lead time from 14 to 7 days
- Increase automated deployments to 80% of releases
- Deploy to production 3x per week (up from 1x)

## Do's

✅ Measure outcomes, not just outputs
✅ Use leading indicators (predict future) not just lagging (historical)
✅ Make metrics visible to teams
✅ Review metrics regularly and take action
✅ Align metrics with business goals

## Don'ts

❌ Measure everything—focus on what matters
❌ Game metrics (teach to the test)
❌ Ignore negative trends
❌ Set unrealistic targets
❌ Measure without acting on data
