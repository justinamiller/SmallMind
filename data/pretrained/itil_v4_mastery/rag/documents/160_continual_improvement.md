# ITIL v4 Continual Improvement Practice

## Purpose

Align organization's practices and services with changing business needs through ongoing identification and improvement.

## Key Concepts

**Continual Improvement**: Recurring organizational activity to ensure services and practices meet stakeholder needs

**Improvement Opportunity**: Idea for improving service or practice

**Improvement Register**: Log of identified opportunities

**Continual Improvement Model**:
1. What is the vision? (Strategic goals)
2. Where are we now? (Baseline assessment)
3. Where do we want to be? (Target state)
4. How do we get there? (Improvement plan)
5. Take action (Execute)
6. Did we get there? (Measure results)
7. How do we keep momentum? (Embed changes)

## Do's
