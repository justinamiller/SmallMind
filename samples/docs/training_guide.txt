SmallMind Training Guide

Training Process:
To train SmallMind, prepare a text corpus and use the Training class. The training process includes:
1. Data loading and tokenization
2. Forward pass through the Transformer
3. Loss calculation (cross-entropy)
4. Backward pass (automatic differentiation)
5. Parameter updates using the optimizer

Hyperparameters:
Important hyperparameters include learning rate (typically 1e-3 to 1e-4), batch size, number of epochs,
block size (context window), embedding dimension, number of layers, and number of attention heads.

The model uses the Adam optimizer with optional learning rate scheduling. Gradient clipping helps
prevent exploding gradients during training.

Best Practices:
- Start with a small dataset to verify your setup
- Monitor training loss to ensure it's decreasing
- Use validation data to check for overfitting
- Save checkpoints regularly
- Consider gradient checkpointing for large models to save memory

Troubleshooting:
If training loss is not decreasing, try lowering the learning rate or increasing the batch size.
If you encounter out-of-memory errors, reduce the batch size or enable gradient checkpointing.
Monitor gradient norms to detect numerical instability.
