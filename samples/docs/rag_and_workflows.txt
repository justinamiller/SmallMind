SmallMind RAG and Workflows

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
SmallMind supports RAG to enhance generation with external knowledge. The RAG pipeline includes:
1. Document ingestion and chunking
2. Indexing with TF-IDF or vector embeddings
3. Query-based retrieval
4. Context-aware prompt assembly
5. Answer generation with citations

The InMemoryLexicalIndex provides deterministic BM25-based retrieval without external dependencies.
For semantic search, you can plug in custom embedding providers.

Workflow Engine:
The workflow system allows you to chain multiple steps for complex tasks. Each workflow step can:
- Read from and write to shared state
- Enforce budgets (tokens, duration, steps)
- Validate outputs (JSON, enums, regex)
- Retry on failure
- Require human approval

Example workflows include IT ticket triage, policy decisions, and multi-step reasoning tasks.
Workflows support deterministic execution for reproducibility.

Chat Sessions:
The ChatOrchestrator manages multi-turn conversations with persistent state. It integrates
retrieval, prompt building, and generation into a cohesive chat experience. Sessions maintain
conversation history and can use RAG to ground responses in retrieved documents.

Integration:
All components are designed to work together: workflows can use RAG, chat sessions can run workflows,
and the entire system supports cancellation tokens, logging, and telemetry.
