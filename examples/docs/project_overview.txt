SmallMind Project Overview

SmallMind is an educational, pure C# language model implementation with no external ML dependencies. 
It demonstrates a decoder-only Transformer architecture (GPT-style) using only native C# classes.

Key Features:
- Custom automatic differentiation engine
- CPU-only execution (no GPU required)
- Character-level tokenization
- Training and inference capabilities
- Production-ready features including explainability, telemetry, and health checks

Architecture:
The model uses a Transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention and feedforward layers. 
The attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence.
Layer normalization and residual connections help with training stability.

Performance Optimizations:
SmallMind includes SIMD vectorization for matrix operations, memory pooling to reduce garbage collection,
and gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency during training. The codebase follows performance best practices
for .NET, including the use of Span<T> and ArrayPool where appropriate.

Use Cases:
SmallMind is ideal for educational purposes, understanding how language models work under the hood,
and experimenting with small-scale language modeling tasks. It can be deployed as a microservice
with built-in health checks and monitoring.
