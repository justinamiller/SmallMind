The cat sat on the mat
The dog sat on the log
The bird flew in the sky
The fish swam in the sea
Cats and dogs are pets
Birds can fly high
Fish live in water
The sun is bright
The moon is white
Stars shine at night
Trees grow tall in the forest
Flowers bloom in spring
Rain falls from the clouds
Snow covers the ground in winter
Children play in the park
People walk on the street
Cars drive on the road
Boats sail on the ocean
Planes fly in the air
Trains run on tracks
